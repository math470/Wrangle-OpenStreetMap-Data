For example, the above output is actually showing 8 store names although 12 names were queried. One way to clean up these names is mapping. For example, mapping = {'711':'7-Eleven', '7 Eleven':'7-Eleven',  '7-11':'7-Eleven', '7/11':'7-Eleven'} can be used as I did for street names. Standardizing names will also make a thorough search for these names possible in this database. However, there are some anticipated problems. First of all, this will require extensive auditing since there are so many of those chain names in various places in the database. Moreover, there might be some similar but different names we do not know how to deal with. Standardizing these names for all areas in OpenStreetMap would be fantastic, but enormous efforts would be required (e.g., making a list of valid store names to guide users). "

Non-standardized phone nummbers and store names were major issues I found, but the phone numebers were easily fixed. The dataset gave a lot of useful information regarding recycling and bicycling. It also met my expectations that it will show environment and bicycle friendliness of Portland. "
